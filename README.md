# *"its not the usual"*

Quick game to revise ideas fron game development in prep for GMTK game jam.

General Game ideas that need refining:

- You shoot with your files on your desktop.
- The larger the file, the heavier it is.
- More damage to the opponent is dealt.
- You attack malware.
- Each malware has their own affinity, so you will have to use the correct folder for the type of malware.
